/*
1. What happens when you forget a break while using switch statement?

if we forget a break while using switch statment it went to the next line and 
that why many didnot like to use it.
2. What will be the output of running following code?

var foo = 0;
switch (foo) {
 case -1:
 console.log('negative 1');
 break;
 case 0:
 console.log(0);//0
 case 1:
 console.log(1);//1
 break;
 case 2:
 console.log(2);
 break;
 default:
 console.log('default');
}
3. Will output change if value of foo is a ‘0’ (0 in quotes) instead?
yes the output will be = "default"
